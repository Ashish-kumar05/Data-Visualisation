# Data-Visualisation
Visualization the data using seaborn library.

# What is Data Visualization?

Data visualization is the representation of data through use of common graphics, such as charts, plots, infographics, and even animations. These visual displays of information communicate complex data relationships and data-driven insights in a way that is easy to understand.

# Seaborn Library
Seaborn is a library for visualization of the graphical statistical plotting in Python. Seaborn provides many color palettes and defaults beautiful styles to make the creation of many statistical plots in Python more attractive.

# Objective of Seaborn library
Seaborn library aims to make a more attractive visualization of the central part of understanding and exploring data. It is built on the core of the matplotlib library.

# Categories of Plots in seaborn library

Distribution plots: This type of plot is used for examining both types of distributions, i.e., univariate and bivariate distribution.

Relational plots: This type of plot is used to understand the relation between the two given variables.

Regression plots: Regression plots in the seaborn library are primarily intended to add an additional visual guide that will help to emphasize dataset patterns during the analysis of exploratory data.

Categorical plots: The categorical plots are used to deals with categories of variables and how we can visualize them.

Multi-plot grids: The multi-plot grids are also a type of plot that is a useful approach is to draw multiple instances for the same plot with different subsets of a single dataset.

Matrix plots: The matrix plots are a type of arrays of the scatterplots.
